Disaster Recovery Plan for AWS Organization

1. Introduction

Purpose of the Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP)
Overview of the AWS organization structure
Importance of disaster recovery for business continuity
2. Risk Assessment

Identify potential risks and threats to AWS resources (e.g., natural disasters, hardware failures, cyberattacks)
Assess the impact of these risks on each account and the organization as a whole
3. DR Strategies and Solutions

Backup and Restore
Regularly backup data and configurations for all accounts
Utilize AWS Backup or other suitable backup solutions
Define backup retention policies for each account based on data criticality
Multi-Region Replication
Replicate critical data and resources across multiple AWS regions
Implement cross-region replication for databases, storage, and other critical services
Ensure failover capability to secondary regions
Disaster Recovery as a Service (DRaaS)
Evaluate DRaaS providers and solutions compatible with AWS
Implement DRaaS for critical applications and services
Test failover and failback procedures regularly
4. Account-Specific DR Plans

DEV and TEST Accounts
Focus on rapid recovery and minimal data loss
Regularly snapshot development and testing environments
Automate environment provisioning and configuration using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like AWS CloudFormation or AWS CDK
PROD Account
Prioritize high availability and data integrity
Implement multi-region redundancy for critical services
Establish automated failover mechanisms for mission-critical applications
Security and Admin Accounts
Ensure continuity of security operations and administrative functions
Maintain separate backup and replication strategies for security configurations and administrative access controls
Establish clear communication and coordination channels for incident response
5. Testing and Maintenance

Schedule regular DR drills and exercises for each account
Document test scenarios and outcomes
Review and update the DR plan based on test results and lessons learned
6. Communication and Escalation

Define communication channels and procedures for notifying stakeholders during a disaster
Establish escalation paths for addressing issues and coordinating response efforts
Assign roles and responsibilities for DR team members
7. Budget and Resources

Estimate the budget required for implementing and maintaining the DR plan
Identify necessary resources (e.g., personnel, tools) and allocate them accordingly
Consider the cost of DRaaS providers, backup storage, and other related expenses
8. Documentation and Training

Document the DR plan in detail, including procedures, contact information, and recovery steps
Provide training to DR team members on their roles and responsibilities
Maintain up-to-date documentation and conduct regular training sessions
9. Compliance and Governance

Ensure compliance with regulatory requirements and industry standards (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA)
Regularly audit and review the DR plan to ensure compliance and effectiveness
Involve legal and compliance teams in the DR planning process
