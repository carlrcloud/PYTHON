Disaster Recovery Plan for AWS Organization

1. Introduction

Purpose of the Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP)
Overview of the AWS organization structure
Importance of disaster recovery for business continuity
2. Risk Assessment

Identify potential risks and threats to AWS resources (e.g., natural disasters, hardware failures, cyberattacks)
Assess the impact of these risks on each account and the organization as a whole
3. DR Strategies and Solutions

Backup and Restore
Regularly backup data and configurations for all accounts
Utilize AWS Backup or other suitable backup solutions
Define backup retention policies for each account based on data criticality
Multi-Region Replication
Replicate critical data and resources across multiple AWS regions
Implement cross-region replication for databases, storage, and other critical services
Ensure failover capability to secondary regions
Disaster Recovery as a Service (DRaaS)
Evaluate DRaaS providers and solutions compatible with AWS
Implement DRaaS for critical applications and services
Test failover and failback procedures regularly
4. Account-Specific DR Plans

DEV and TEST Accounts
Focus on rapid recovery and minimal data loss
Regularly snapshot development and testing environments
Automate environment provisioning and configuration using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like AWS CloudFormation or AWS CDK
PROD Account
Prioritize high availability and data integrity
Implement multi-region redundancy for critical services
Establish automated failover mechanisms for mission-critical applications
Security and Admin Accounts
Ensure continuity of security operations and administrative functions
Maintain separate backup and replication strategies for security configurations and administrative access controls
Establish clear communication and coordination channels for incident response
5. Testing and Maintenance

Schedule regular DR drills and exercises for each account
Document test scenarios and outcomes
Review and update the DR plan based on test results and lessons learned
6. Communication and Escalation

Define communication channels and procedures for notifying stakeholders during a disaster
Establish escalation paths for addressing issues and coordinating response efforts
Assign roles and responsibilities for DR team members
7. Budget and Resources

Estimate the budget required for implementing and maintaining the DR plan
Identify necessary resources (e.g., personnel, tools) and allocate them accordingly
Consider the cost of DRaaS providers, backup storage, and other related expenses
8. Documentation and Training

Document the DR plan in detail, including procedures, contact information, and recovery steps
Provide training to DR team members on their roles and responsibilities
Maintain up-to-date documentation and conduct regular training sessions
9. Compliance and Governance

Ensure compliance with regulatory requirements and industry standards (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA)
Regularly audit and review the DR plan to ensure compliance and effectiveness
Involve legal and compliance teams in the DR planning process
10. Summary and Recommendations
- Summarize key points of the DR plan
- Provide recommendations for implementation and improvement
- Seek approval from top management for the DR plan and associated resources

11. Appendix
- Include additional resources, templates, and references


The pilot light approach and the warm standby approach are two disaster recovery strategies that involve having a standby environment ready to take over in case of a disaster. While both approaches aim to minimize downtime and recovery time, they differ in how they prepare and maintain the standby environment.

In the pilot light approach:

Initial Setup: Organizations set up a minimal version of their production environment in a standby AWS Region. This minimal setup typically includes essential components needed to run critical applications or services.
Activation Process: In the event of a disaster, organizations need to "turn on" the standby environment by deploying additional infrastructure and scaling up resources. This may involve provisioning additional servers, databases, and other necessary components to fully restore the production environment.
Resource Consumption: Since the standby environment starts with minimal resources, organizations have lower ongoing costs. However, they need to scale up and deploy additional infrastructure during a disaster, which may lead to increased resource consumption and higher costs temporarily.
In contrast, the warm standby approach:

Initial Setup: Organizations maintain a fully functional replica of their production environment in another AWS Region. This replica includes all necessary infrastructure, servers, databases, and other components required to run the workload.
Activation Process: In the event of a disaster, organizations only need to scale up the existing standby environment to handle increased workload demand. Since everything is already deployed and running in the standby environment, there is no need to deploy additional infrastructure or components.
Resource Consumption: The warm standby approach typically incurs higher ongoing costs compared to the pilot light approach since resources are constantly running in the standby environment. However, organizations benefit from faster recovery times as there is no need to deploy additional infrastructure during a disaster.
In summary, while both the pilot light and warm standby approaches offer effective disaster recovery solutions, they differ in their initial setup, activation process, and ongoing resource consumption. The pilot light approach starts with minimal resources and requires scaling up during a disaster, while the warm standby approach maintains a fully functional standby environment ready for immediate activation.
