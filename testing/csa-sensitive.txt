Check the File System Type:
Confirm that your macOS file system is case-insensitive (default for most macOS installations). If it's case-sensitive, the issue might be caused by something else.

You can check the file system type by running:

bash
Copy code
diskutil info / | grep 'File System Personality'
Look for "Case-sensitive" in the output.

Force a Fresh Clone:
Ensure you are performing a completely fresh clone by removing any cached configurations or remnants:

bash
Copy code
rm -rf <repo-folder>
git clone <repository-url> <repo-folder>
cd <repo-folder>
Set core.ignorecase to false:
Before performing any operations in the newly cloned repository, set the core.ignorecase configuration to false:

bash
Copy code
git config core.ignorecase false
Check for Colliding Files:
Identify the colliding files by running:

bash
Copy code
git ls-tree -r HEAD | awk '{print $4}' | sort | uniq -d
This command lists files that only differ by case.

Resolve Collisions Manually:
If collisions are found, rename the files manually to ensure they have unique names. For example:

bash
Copy code
git mv conflictingfile1 conflictingfile1_temp
git mv conflictingfile2 conflictingfile2_corrected
git mv conflictingfile1_temp conflictingfile1_corrected
Commit the Changes:
After renaming the files, commit the changes:

bash
Copy code
git add .
git commit -m "Resolved case-sensitive path collisions"
Check the Status:
Verify that the issue has been resolved:

bash
Copy code
git status
Pull Latest Changes Carefully:
If you're pulling changes from a remote repository, ensure you handle any potential collisions:

bash
Copy code
git fetch
git pull


--------------------

The output indicates that your file system is APFS, which by default is case-insensitive on macOS. Here are the steps to resolve the case-sensitive path collisions in your Git repository:

Check for Case-Sensitive Files in the Repository:
Identify files that differ only by case in the repository. Use the following command to list such files:

bash
Copy code
git ls-tree -r HEAD | awk '{print $4}' | sort | uniq -di
This command lists all files tracked by Git, sorts them, and shows duplicates (which indicate case differences).

Resolve File Name Collisions:
If you find files that differ only by case, you will need to rename them so that their names are unique. Here's an example of how you can rename the files:

bash
Copy code
git mv filename1 filename1_temp
git mv filename2 filename2_corrected
git mv filename1_temp filename1_corrected
Replace filename1, filename1_temp, and filename2_corrected with the actual file names involved in the collision.

Commit the Changes:
After renaming the files, stage the changes and commit them:

bash
Copy code
git add .
git commit -m "Resolved case-sensitive path collisions"
Ensure Git Respects Case Sensitivity:
Set the core.ignorecase configuration to false to ensure Git respects case sensitivity in the future:

bash
Copy code
git config core.ignorecase false
Re-clone the Repository (If Necessary):
If you continue to experience issues, you might want to re-clone the repository again after performing the above steps:

bash
Copy code
rm -rf <repo-folder>
git clone <repository-url> <repo-folder>
cd <repo-folder>
Verify Configuration:
Check the current value of core.ignorecase to confirm itâ€™s set correctly:

bash
Copy code
git config --get core.ignorecase
This should output false.

Check Repository Status:
Verify that the issue has been resolved:

bash
Copy code
git status
