Subject: Notice: Upcoming Cleanup of Non-Compliant Security Groups

Dear Tenants,

We are reaching out to inform you about an upcoming cleanup of Security Groups (SGs) in our shared AWS environment. This cleanup will focus on:
	1.	Security Groups that are properly tagged but are open to the world (0.0.0.0/0) and not attached to any EC2 instance.

These Security Groups will be automatically deleted to ensure compliance with our security policies.

Important Recommendations

To avoid issues and improve management, we ask you to take the following actions:
	1.	Tag Your Resources Properly
	•	Ensure all your resources, including Security Groups, are tagged appropriately (e.g., with Owner, Team, Environment). Proper tagging helps us identify ownership and maintain better governance.
	2.	Use the Service Catalog for Resource Creation
	•	We recommend using the Service Catalog to create Security Groups and other resources. This ensures compliance with organizational policies and facilitates easier management.
	3.	Verify and Update Your Security Groups
	•	Review your existing Security Groups, especially those with rules allowing unrestricted access (0.0.0.0/0).
	•	Correct any non-compliant rules by limiting access to trusted IP ranges or removing such rules where they are not necessary.

Deadline for Action

Please ensure your resources are tagged properly and your Security Groups are reviewed and updated by [Deadline Date]. After this date, any non-compliant Security Groups (tagged, open to the world, and unattached) will be automatically deleted.

If you have any questions or need assistance with tagging or updating your Security Groups, please do not hesitate to contact us.

Thank you for your cooperation and for helping us maintain a secure and compliant environment.

Best regards,
